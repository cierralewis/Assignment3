    <p>
        My name is Cierra Lewis; born in Hattiesburg, MS but raised in Denver, CO.
        Since being at Spelman, I am apart of Upsilon Pi Epsilon Honor Society for
        Computer Science, ACM, and Movements of Praise. As of this year, I am apart
        of a research group- conducted with Dr. Volcy- creating an interactive 3D model
        of Spelman's campus; my role being creating a mobile application that retreives a
        user's longitude and latitude coordinates, sending it to a server, converting the
        coordinates to pixel x and y's, so they can be displayed on the 3D model. When I'm
        not in class, I can be found at the movies; collecting movie tickets from
        various theaters, locations, etc.

            <h3 style="text-align: center">Why Computer Science?</h3>
            <p> Ever since I could remember, I have always wanted to be a animator. The thought of
                taking a mere drawing, bringing it to life, giving it a story that can impact
                people of all ages struck a cord in me. Animation requires two of the most
                evolving and innovative things in our society: art and technology. So it was only
                natural to assume that when it was time to pick a major I originally chose Art. I
                thought I can gain skills on creating storyboards, characters; a transition that
                will lead me to Art. I was wrong. The art department at Spelman only catered to the
                generic types of visual art; painting, sculpting, drawing. Thinking back to what
                animation entails, my sophomore year I switched from art to computer science; and I
                haven't regretted it since.

               <p>
                After graduation, I will enter NBCUniversal's NexTech Associate Program. This program
                   is a 2-year rotational program in which I will spend 8-12 months in various
                   departments at NBCU's various locations; Seattle, LA, Miami, Denver, New York City,
                   Stamford, and/or Englewood Cliffs.During the 2-year rotational program, not will I
                   be learning about the magic behind NBC's various movies and TV shows with hands-on
                   experience, but I will be training for a unique Technical Certificate Program.
                   Upon completion of the program, I will be placed in a full-time position with NBCU.
